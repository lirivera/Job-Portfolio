Dear Ms. Perez,
 
It is with enthusiasm that I am submitting my application for the position of Evaluation Associate. As a company that provides comprehensive evaluation services to clients in the education and non-profit fields, I believe SmartStart’s unique environment and collaborative organizational structure would be the perfect fit for me and my skills in research and evaluation.
 
My passion for program evaluation began in graduate school and I continue to be inspired by the powerful roles data and information play in achieving programmatic goals and successful project outcomes.

Focusing my career on developing the necessary skills to garner this power effectively is a priority I view as critical to making a positive impact in education.

It has been my priority to focus my career on developing the necessary skills to garner this power effectively to make a positive impact in education.

Over the past 5 years I have been fortunate to work on a diverse range of projects from data collection for federal grant initiatives such as 21st Century Learning Community Learning Centers to creating evaluation models for state initiatives such as Florida’s new teacher evaluation model.  
 
I am confident the skills I have acquired are very well suited to meet the goals of your organization and the requirements of this position. Key applicable skills include:

Analytical Proficiency | I truly enjoy conducting research, literature views and analyzing information. I am enthusiastic about using statistical software to perform basic statistics and have experience with programs such as R, STATA and SPSS.

Data Communication | I have extensive experience synthesizing technical information and tailoring reports for multiple audiences such as policy makers, school leaders and parents. As a researcher I have found effectively and clearly communicating results invaluable in ensuring results are actually used in programmatic decision-making. 

Data Management | I work with SQL on a daily basis and efficiently manage large, complex and confidential datasets. I am highly detail-oriented and truly embrace the subtle nuances of gathering data. I strive to ensure decisions made throughout each step of the data collection and cleaning process are critically analyzed and are carefully considered in the interpretation of findings and outcomes. 
 
If I am offered this position my background in education will allow me to continue applying a unique analytical lens to this field. I welcome the opportunity to continue to working with data while also growing my career as an evaluator and hope to further discuss my additional revenant experiences in person. Looking forward to hearing from your office.

Best,
Hidahis F. Mesa
