Dear Ms. Perez,

It is with great enthusiasm that I am submitting my application for the position of Evaluation Associate. As a company that provides comprehensive evaluation services to clients in the education and non-profit fields, I believe SmartStartâ€™s unique environment and collaborative organizational structure would be the perfect fit for me and my skills in research and evaluation.

My passion for program evaluation began in graduate school and I continue to be inspired by the powerful roles data and information play in achieving programmatic goals. Focusing my career on developing the necessary skills to garner this power effectively is a priority I view as critical to making a positive impact in education. Over the past 5 years I have been fortunate to work on a multitude of diverse of projects ranging from collecting complex datasets for federal grants to developing teacher evaluation models for state initiatives.I am confident the skills I have acquired are very well suited to meet the goals of your organization and the requirements of this position.

Key applicable skills include:

 Analytical Proficiency | I truly enjoy all aspects of research and have a strong background in quantitative data analysis and working with programs such as R and SPSS. Qualitatively, I have extensive experience conducting literature reviews and have worked in evaluation teams to conduct several surveys, interviews and focus groups.

Data Reporting | Producing reports for multiple audiences such as policy makers, university researchers, and parents, has taught me to effectively synthesize technical information and given me the ability to clearly communicate results.

Data Management | Self-taught in SQL --a large part of my daily responsibilities as a research manager now comprises of managing large, complex and confidential datasets. I am highly detail-oriented and truly embrace the subtle nuances of gathering data. Decisions I make throughout each step of the data collection and cleaning process are critically analyzed and are carefully considered in interpretations of findings and outcomes.

Team Work and Flexibility | Although I have worked remotely for the past several years and have been trusted to independently carry out my assignments, I have always worked closely with over 128 researchers, 30 principals, and 10 district department leaders. Identifying data needs, modifying requests, and providing leaders with the correct information they need requires partnership and I take pride in being a flexible member of many teams.

If offered this position my background in education will allow me to apply a unique analytical lens to the needs of SmartStart ECS. I welcome the opportunity to continue to working with data and am motivated to continue growing my career as an evaluator. I look forward to hearing from your office and hope to further discuss my additional relevant experiences in person.

Best,
